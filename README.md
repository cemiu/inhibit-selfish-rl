# inhibit-selfish-rl

This codebase was used for my final year research project, as part of my BSc CompSci degree in 2022/23.

At the time of creation, these commands worked for setting up all dependencies. With SB3 moving to gymnasium & imitation planning to later do the same, this is unlikely to work anymore.

pip install opencv-python matplotlib pandas seaborn tensorboard numpy imitation jupyter
pip install git+https://github.com/carlosluis/stable-baselines3@fix_tests
